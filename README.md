# SillyChatter
Something along the lines of a super unsafe and crashy chat server >_&lt;
###Registration
The user will not be allowed to send any messages until login or registration is done. 
- **Registering:** Client will verify valid user/pass and send register msg to server. Server will verify it and add it to a list of registered users.
- **Un-Registering:** User have an option to unregister their account. A unregister msg will be sent to server. The username will be freed up. Not sure if this will be implemented yet.
